# Introduction
Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java
    - variables
    - data types
    - methods
    - control flow
## Programming Paradigms
- Procedural
- **Functional**
- **Object-Oriented**
- Event-Driven
- Logic
- Aspect-Oriented

### Ideas
- Not languages but rather styles of how you code
- JavaScript, Java and Python support multiple paradigms
- Objects are units that contain data (state) and methods (behavior)
- OO - keeps data and behavior together in objects
- Functional - separates data from behavior and treats them fundamentally different

## Benefits of OO
- Car parts are replaceable

Benefits
- Reduced Complexity
- Easier Maintenance
- Code Reuse
- Faster Development

## Course Structure
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Classes
- Refactor Towards OO Code
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Interfaces
